        <h2>How do I use Oratorio?</h2>
        <p>
            The user interface is designed to be minimalistic and simple to use. Simply click the "RECORD" button on the homepage to start recording your speech. The toggle switch located under the "RECORD" button toggles a mirror that allows you to use your webcam input as a mirror so you can see yourself while you present. Oratorio will analyze the speech and provide statistics. In order to view the transcipt of your speech and statisics, you need to sign in with Google by clicking on the "Sign In" button located in the upper-right hand corner of the pages. View your past speeches by clicking on the menu icon located on the top-left hand side after signing in!

        <p>
            With Oratorio, it is very easy to group your recordings and organize them. For each speech you want to work on, you can create lots of recordings and they will be grouped by speech. You can even work on two different speeches and switch between both of them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Oratorio provides many statistics that a human cannot provide. For example, it can immediately calculate and tell you the pacing of your recording and save it to your speech. It then calculates your running average WPM for each speech and can even calculate it on a per person basis so that you can see how your average improves over time.
